          label: Introduction
          body: "<p>By limiting the functionality of the blockchain and dedicating it specifically to decentralized finance, DeFi Blockchain provides high transaction throughput, reduced risk of errors, and intelligent feature development specifically for the fulfillment of Satoshiâ€™s original intent: To create a reliable alternative form of financial services built on top of Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, as described in the original Satoshi whitepaper, is designed as a form of digital cash, as a store and exchange of value. The evolution to Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed for tremendous new functionalities to be built on top of the blockchain, yet this development has come at a cost. The concept of one global operating system for everything has created a system that requires a complex code base for smart contracts, slow throughput and difficulty around the governance of the system.</p><p>The DeFi blockchain approaches decentralized finance as a specific and critical segment of the blockchain community. DeFi is a dedicated blockchain that is optimized specifically for DeFi applications. The DeFi blockchain is intentionally non Turing-Complete and does not support any function, other than= those needed for Decentralized Finance, resulting in a blockchain that provides higher throughput and better functionality specifically for dApps related to finance.</p>"
